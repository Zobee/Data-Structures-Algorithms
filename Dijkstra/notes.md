# Dijkstra's Algorithm
It's a super famous algorithm. Uses graphs and binary heaps.

## What is it?
Basically, it finds the shortest path between two verticies on a graph. We're making Google Maps, baby! Not just used in GPS. Can be used to model a bunch of things from the spread of viruses, to finding the cheapest flights for your next trip.

## Who Dijkstra?
Edgar Dijkstra was a very smart boy. Programmer, physicist, advanced the study of computer science. Read his shit.
